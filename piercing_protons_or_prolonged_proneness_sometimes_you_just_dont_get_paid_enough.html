    <p>As world class atom smashers go, I’m a die-hard Fermilab fan. For awhile I cheered for the Stanford Linear Accelerator (“SLAC”), but then I moved back to Chicago. Right now, all the buzz is centered around the Large Hadron Collidor (“LHC”) in Europe. (I’ve been to Europe. It’s far away and kind of expensive. I suggest EPCOT center instead. It’s closer and the bathrooms are cleaner.) The search for advanced particles may seem like a sleepy afternoon in the bleachers at Higg’s Field. But particle physics, like most other human endeavors, involves a surprising amount of risk, danger, and injury. The hero in our story took a proton beam in the face and lived to tell about it. That’s a bean­ball that would make any major league pitcher blush.</p><hr><h3><em>Risk Is Everywhere</em></h3><p>Everything in life involves taking risks and finance is no differ­ent. But in finance, unlike certain other realms, risk is supposed to have a value which can be priced. In finance, folks expect to be compensated for the risk they take and expect to pay for the risks they put off onto others. This is the basic principle behind “Risk Premiums,” bigger risks should command bigger rewards. Risk and reward don’t have to be measured in money, or even in numbers; for the principle to hold true, however, it’s easier to think about it that way.</p><p>This makes good common sense: If you compare two differ­ent investments promising the same financial returns, it makes sense to choose the least risky of the two. Like most finance principles, it’s not an exact science; it works best <em>on-average and over-time</em>. But investors should always be cognizant of the risks they are taking and the premium or spread they are receiving for taking that bundle of risks.</p><hr><h3><em>Our Dear Comrade Bugorski</em></h3><p>The problem gets hard, however, when we are not fully aware of the risks we are actually taking. For example, consider the plight of one AnatoliBugorski. He was a dedicated Soviet sci­entist that devoted his entire life to particle physics. He worked for a world class atom smasher, an important proton accelerator laboratory. But in true Soviet fashion, his comrades were a bit too casual in verifying that the safety mechanisms on the equip­ment were actually working:</p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><em>In 1978 Anatoli Bugorski was a 36-year-old researcher at the In­stitute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, one of the secret So­viet science towns. One day he was checking a piece of accelerator equipment that had apparently malfunctioned. Unfortunately, so had its safety mechanisms. When Bugorski leaned over to look into the equipment, he stuck his head into the space normally occupied by the proton beam. Before he realized his mistake, he saw a flash “brighter than a thousand suns.” Apparently, over the next few days, the skin on the back of his head…peeled away to reveal the path the beam had burned through the skin, the skull, and the brain tissue…Still, not only did Bugorski not die, but he remained a normally functioning human being, capable even of continuing in science. (Source: The Future Ruins of the Nuclear Age by Masha Gessen, Wired Magazine, Issue 5.12, Dec 1997.)</em></span></p><p>Bugorski had a hole bored in his head by a tiny but unbe­lievably powerful beam of atomic matter. Nobody, especially his comrades, were able to figure out why he didn’t die. But the beam passed straight through his face, skull, skin, and brain without killing him, truly one for the record books.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/s%26P500%20for%20a%20decade_1.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 282px;"></p><p>We all know that taking risks is a part of life, and Bugor­ski was obviously no dummy. But even so, he probably had no idea that he was getting paid to take a face full of quarks and gluons. He undoubtedly had a sense of Soviet workplace safety standards (an oxymoron) but probably hadn’t considered he was betting his life on that.</p><p>As it turned out, he was a very lucky man. No one is quite sure how he managed to burn a hole straight through his head without dying. According to journalists, Bugorski eventually developed seizures later in life as a result of his injuries, but in the main, he was able to work. Of course the Soviet health care system denied him the medicine he needed. But despite all this, the man continued working on his research projects in Prot­vino, one of the bankrupt little Soviet science towns—towns which remain one of the oddest categories of Cold War relics.</p><hr><h3><em>Getting Headaches from the Stock Market</em></h3><p>Over the last ten years, many stock market investors have felt like they’ve had holes burned in their heads by the stock market. They are not wrong. A buy-and-hold investor received no reward for investing in stocks for much of the last decade. In fact, if you bought the S&amp;P 500 (an index of 500 of the biggest U.S. stocks) in January of 2000 and left your money in for twelve years, you lost money.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/no%20equity%20risk%20premium%202000%20-%202012.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 277px;"></p><p>This goes against traditional financial logic which says that over material periods of time, stock investors should expect to receive compensation for the “extra” risks they take by investing in equities as opposed to investing in debt. This is called the “Equity Risk Premium” (“ERP”).</p><p>But over the last decade, the equity risk premium was es­sentially nil. Unless one had superb timing based on a superbly tuned crystal ball, the S&amp;P returned about the same as the 10 year treasury (3-4%) or even less. That means that, over the last decade, a stock investor did not get paid to take the extra risk in owning stocks over that period.</p><p>The equity risk premium is a textbook finance concept which tries to quantity these ideas. It refers to the amount of ad­ditional investment return an equity-like bundle of risks should provide over a similarly situated bond-like bundle of risks, and the point is even more dramatic if one uses the proverbial “risk-free rate of return,” as the basis for the comparison. The risk-free rate used to be equated with U.S. government bonds, often the 10 year treasury. Sometimes, I’m not so sure any more.</p><hr><h3><em>What Should the Equity Risk Premium Be?</em></h3><p>What return should a stock buyer demand relative to that of a bond buyer? How much more should a company have to reward stock buyers relative to bond buyers? As it turns out, the number fluctuates because it is set by the market. Despite recent history, the markets generally rewarded equity investors over long peri­ods of time. Here are some statistics:</p><ul><li>Between 1926-1997 the stock market returned an aver­age total return of about 7.7%.</li><li>Between 1926-1997 bonds returned an average of about 2.4%.</li><li>That means that in rough numbers the equity risk pre­mium averaged 5.3% for that ~ 70 year period.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><em>&nbsp;(Source: The Equity Risk Premium, by Bradford Cornell, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999.)</em></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compare this to the last ten to twenty years: During the 1990’s the equity risk premium dropped consistently below 2%. During the decade of the year 2000, it flat-lined.</p><hr><h3><em>Why Did Stocks Suck?</em></h3><p>Why did equities perform so badly during this period? There are many reasons and many ways to interpret the data of course, but I personally believe that Wall Street was able to get people to forget what stocks actually were, and therefore people became willing to pay too much for them. If people pay too much for an asset, their returns will be poor by definition.</p><p>Like any kind of security, stocks represent a bundle of legal rights being purchased by an investor. In the case of most com­mon stocks, these rights represent a portion of corporate owner­ship, the right to vote as a shareholder, and the right to receive dividends. (Dividends? What are those?)</p><p>But during the heydey of the 1990’s and the 2000’s, inves­tors became mesmerized by the huge sums they could make when big companies gobbled up other companies in exchange for megabucks. This was at the height of the dot.com boom as well as the takeover boom of the mid-2000’s. Blinded by the huge numbers touted by the financial media and Wall Street, too many investors ignored the mundane realities of net income and cash flow, ignored dilution by insider stock options and new share issuance; ignored managements with a total disdain for dividends, preferring instead to drive revenues, non-GAAP earnings, and “EBITDA.” For a variety of reasons, too many stocks spent a significant period of the 1990’s and the first half of the 2000’s overvalued and overhyped, meaning that inves­tors were paying way to much for assuming the risks that they were actually taking.</p><p>Does that mean it was impossible to make money investing in stocks during the last decade? No, it certainly does not. But it means that it has been a “stock picker’s” market and even a “trader’s market,” rewarding folks that bought cheap and sold dear rather than blindly buying and holding forever. <em>It required making sure that one got paid for the risk one was taking. </em>This re­warded folks that took advantage of significant buying oppor­tunities when prices were too good to pass up or bought shares in firms that paid cash flows to their investors in the form of dividends. Of course, there were plenty of “take-outs” during that period as well. Everyone has a story about a company pur­chased by Microsoft, Oracle, Google, or Apple. But in the end, risk only gets rewarded if people properly price the risk they are buying and selling.</p><hr><h3><em>Wrapping Up the Inning<span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_410E" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></em></h3><p>Comrade Bugorski was a big league player and a man of tre­mendous fortitude and drive. He showed us that often we take risks we can’t even imagine and that risk is not always prop­erly rewarded. He also showed us the toughness and fortitude which human beings can display, but that’s a story for another day.</p><p>Ralph Wanger has frequently pointed out that the return on certain asset classes such as stocks can be lousy for significantly long periods of time. I’ve gone to his speeches on the subject. They make a lot of sense. Risk premiums do mean revert, but the cycles seem to be extremely long, often lasting more than a decade. Interestingly, Ralph, too, has a hole in his head, but it doesn’t seem to have slowed his fastball or created any problems for the Soviet health care system—at least for now.</p><p>Eric Wanger, JD, CFA</p>
