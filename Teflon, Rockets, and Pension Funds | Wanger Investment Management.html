    <p>Teflon is really cool: Nothing will stick to it. It’s the 
slipperiest, slickest, most friction-free stuff around. The stickiest, 
messiest, gooiest mess slides right off. Teflon is used in industry 
whenever friction simply won’t do. Because nothing sticks to it, it’s 
appli­cations seem endless. In the pantheon of chemically engineered 
gods, Teflon stands near Zeus.</p><p>When a person is referred to as 
“Teflon,” it means that noth­ing sticks to them in the political sense. 
Ronald Reagan was sometimes referred to as the Teflon president. He was 
such a masterful politician that he could jump fully clothed into a vat 
of pure nasty and climb out smelling like a rose. He dodged scandal 
after scandal, gaff after gaff, like some kind of Moham­med Ali of 
politics, floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee. In public 
life, Teflon is the “X factor” which separates the very good from the 
truly great. Political careers are made and destroyed in the public 
forum, without a judge or a jury. Politi­cal teflon is that amazing 
ability to stand calmly and assertively while political opponents hurl 
chamber pots filled with shame and blame, only to watch it all slide off
 without leaving so much as a crumb on one’s suit. And that, of course, 
brings us to the subject of public pension funds.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="Teflon,%20Rockets,%20and%20Pension%20Funds%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/teflon%2520pan%2520and%2520eggs.JPG" style="width: 228px; height: 200px;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8px;">DuPoint Inventor Roy Plunkett discovered Teflon in 1938, DuPont<sup>TM</sup> Teflon® fluoropolymer is one of the most slippery materials in existend and resists both heat and chemicals.</span></p><p>It
 is well understood that public pension funds around the country are in a
 state of utter disarray. According to the Pew Center on the States, 
employees’ public pension and health in­surance funds were underfunded 
by more than $1 trillion in 2008. Grossly negligent financial 
mismanagement, irrespon­sible return assumptions, and imprudent risk 
taking have com­bined with chronic underfunding to leave a swath of 
destruc­tion in their wake. State governments around the nation have 
failed to stash away anything close to the amount of money their (often 
elderly) beneficiaries are owed. Had these fiducia­ries operated in the 
private sector, they would have been fined or even jailed under ERISA. 
One study found that the average funding rate across the 59 city and 
state pension plans surveyed was 54 percent. Another study estimates 
that teacher pension systems across the nation are underfunded by $484 
billion. The Pew Center on the States rated state pension funds on a 4 
point scale and gave <em>zero</em> points to Alaska, Colorado, Illinois,
 Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey and Oklahoma. In the private 
sector, there would be FBI raids, press conferences, and men in suits 
hiding their faces behind handcuffed wrists on the evening news.</p><p>But
 has anyone been punished because $1 trillion (some es­timates place it 
at $3 trillion) has gone astray? No.Will anyone be punished in the 
future? It’s doubtful, but the lawsuits have just begun to fly. Why? The
 individuals that approved the over­blown rates of investment return are
 faceless, the committee members that approved the underfunded budgets 
have moved on, and the deficits are so big they have no meaning to the 
aver­age person. The public debate has nowhere to go but to other 
is­sues—issues that can be used to win legislative seats, sway 
elec­tions, enhance prosecutorial resumes, or buy voters with pork. 
That’s Teflon in action. Despite the enormity of the crisis, there is 
nothing political for it to stick to so all of the blame and 
em­barrassment will simply slide off.</p><p>Examine the current political debate regarding public pen­sions: It has been cleverly shifted to the <em>current </em>salaries and ben­efits currently being paid or promised to <em>existing</em>
 state and fed­eral workers. That’s clever sleight of political hand, 
but diverts us from the real issue. Teflon is at work and the taxpayers 
will be left to clean up the mess.</p><p>No discussion of teflon would 
be complete without ac­knowledging the most non-stick man of the last 
century, Wer­ner Von Braun. Read Michael Neufeld’s excellent biography 
of him. It’s excellent and done to standards which should make the 
Smithsonian proud.</p><p>Werner Von Braun was a German rocket scientist 
straight from central casting. Remember Dr. Strangelove? Yeah, that guy.
 Von Braun was a founding father of U.S. rocketry; both ballistic 
missiles for war and the manned space program for peace.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"> </span><img alt="" src="Teflon,%20Rockets,%20and%20Pension%20Funds%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/werner-von-braun%2520portrait.JPG" style="width: 159px; height: 200px;"><br>
<span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8px;">Portrait of Werner Von Braun.</span></p><p>As
 one of the principle architects of our manned space program, he was the
 father of the Saturn V rocket (still the most impressive rocket in 
human history for my money) and the tall, handsome, blonde-hair, 
blue-eyed, German accented, face of the “dream of space” for a 
generation of Americans. His entire professional life was devoted to the
 dream of putting men into orbit and onto the moon.“I aim at the stars,”
 he is famously quoted.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><img alt="" src="Teflon,%20Rockets,%20and%20Pension%20Funds%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/V2_Rocket_12_69b.JPG" style="width: 105px; height: 250px;"><br>
<span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>But 
few Americans know the extent of his amazing and bi­zarre history: 
Within the space of a single lifetime, he was the pampered son of a 
German Baron; the Director of the Nazi’s Peenemunde rocket development 
site; the father of the infa­mous Nazi V2 ballistic missile; a “Colonel”
 in the SS; a recipient of the Fuehrer’s “Knight’s Cross” medal for 
service to the Reich; then, after choosing the United States over the 
Soviet Union at the end of the European war, a key player in the U.S. 
Army’s own ballistic missile program; a senior NASA administrator; an 
influential congressional lobbyist; a public face of the U.S. manned 
spaceflight program; a guest on Walt Disney’s televi­sion programs; and 
the father of the Saturn V rocket (which made the Apollo program 
possible and made it possible to put men on the moon). And, if Neufeld 
is correct, Von Braun was within days of receiving the Congressional 
Medal of Honor from the President before someone figured out that he had
 been personally decorated by Hitler! As Tom Lehrer famously sang, “<em>Nazi Schmazi, says Werner Von Braun.</em>”</p><p>So
 here is a man that was born in the greatest luxury known to pre-war 
Europe, spent the war eating good food, drinking good wine, and going to
 parties in a tuxedo (and wearing his SS officer’s uniform when 
required). He was a post-war “guest” of the U.S. army, ultimately rising
 to the highest levels of the U.S. space establishment and its public 
face. He appeared on televi­sion and in print and he testified before 
Congress. He dined at the White House. He died a hero after helping to 
dedicate the Smithsonian Air and Space museum.</p><p>Teflon is thriving:
 Goldman Sachs will survive Congres­sional hearings and hundreds of 
millions in fines. Sarah Palin abdicated the governorship of Alaska in 
order to free up time for speaking tours and book publishing. Michael 
Jordan’s gam­bling? Bill Clinton’s perjury? Teflon people, truly 
non-stick hu­mans.</p><p>But what of our public pension funds? If only 
Tom Lehrer were here: “Fiduciary, schmiduciary,” he would sing. 
Remem­ber Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove? If one can learn to love the
 bomb, one can certainly learn to love huge deficits and the taxes we 
will have to pay to reinflate them. Real teflon is amazing stuff. It is 
so slippery it can help wash away the responsibility for the V2 
ballistic missile.In the words of comedian Mort Sahl: “I aim for the 
stars…but sometimes I hit London.”</p><p>Eric Wanger, JD, CFA <em><span class="byline">President,<br>
