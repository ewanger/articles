  <div class="content">
    <p>Q2 was a tough quarter. Energy soared and financials plunged. The
 Long Term Opportunity Fund which appeared well-hedged and cleverly 
invested through May, took a nose dive in June. While we believe our 
investments will do extremely well in the long run, there is no doubt 
that we took a lot of punishment in the short run.</p>
<h3>Oil.</h3>
<p>Oil prices skyrocketed near $150/barrel when legitimate buyers, 
speculators and energy-subsidizing governments conspired (along with the
 continuing plunge of the value of the US dollar) to push the price of a
 barrel of oil to new heights. Gasoline prices shot up to more than 
$4.00 per gallon while the press and politicians, all too predictably, 
began screaming for quick fixes and villains to blame. The Democrats 
demanded that we punish “big oil” while the Republicans demanded 
offshore drilling--lots of heat without much light.</p>
<p>But in the midst of the chaos, something very interesting did occur: 
US gasoline consumption (which represents approximately half of US 
demand for oil) dropped dramatically. We learned, for example, that the 
largest highway fuel provider (i.e. truck stop) in America reported a 
12% yearover-year decline in sales of some of its major fuel categories.
 We have all heard about America’s insatiable thirst for oil. But we 
just saw proof that demand for gasoline, like everything else in the 
real economic world, is ultimately subject to the laws of supply and 
demand, responding to price and availability.</p>
<p>We believe the price of oil will settle down in the near/ 
intermediate term. It is our view that prices got ahead of themselves, 
and despite any long-term issues regarding the crude oil supply chain, a
 US dollar denominated price of $150 is simply too much too soon. The 
American driver seems quite willing to drive less to save money. China 
will not be able to continue its $100 billion energy subsidies 
indefinitely without taking a significant toll on its own economy and 
currency. Maybe we’ll see $150 oil eventually, but it won’t be back 
right away.</p>
<h3>Auto.</h3>
<p>The second quarter also saw more angst from Detroit. The major auto 
makers continued to report precipitous declines in the sales of trucks 
and SUV’s. This is not really a surprise. It simply tells us that 
consumers will respond to actual prices in a way they won’t respond to 
cajoling, moralizing or propaganda. It’s hard to imagine that the Big 3 
auto makers will rebound any time soon. Americans seem to have finally 
lost their appetite for SUV’s and trucks, the last bastion of margins 
for Detroit. While there is much discussion about hybrids and electric 
cars, it will be a long time before they will move the needle.</p>
<h3>Financials.</h3>
<p>The drama in the financial sector was unprecedented during the second
 quarter. Rumors began to flourish that Lehman was going to go under 
and, like Bear Stearns, get stuffed into some type of back-room forced 
acquisition. It’s shares dropped 55% during the period. Just as 
dramatic, investors worried--legitimately so, that both FannieMae and 
FreddieMac, the two juggernaut mortgage insurers would both go bankrupt,
 forcing the federal government to take them over. It was a period of 
unprecedented volatility in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are not out of the woods yet. There will certainly 
be more big write downs among the financials. While we’ve probably 
absorbed many of the biggest mutli-billion dollar write-downs stemming 
from the initial residential mortgage debacle, we still haven’t seen the
 full aftermath of the condo crisis, the consumer slowdown or commercial
 credit crunch. With the economy slowing and commodity prices high, the 
consumer will drive fewer miles and spend big dollars at the shopping 
mall. Furthermore, more consumers will be defaulting on their credit 
card bills:</p>
<p>This is already starting to occur. According to the Wall Street 
Journal, in the second quarter, delinquencies on Citigroup’s total 
credit-card portfolio were up nearly 12% from the end of last year to 
about $4.27 billion. Delinquencies on the securitized portion of that 
portfolio had a 16% rise during the same stretch. Additionally, rising 
defaults on credit-card payments, coupled with a bleaker economic 
outlook, are spooking investors in the market where this debt is 
packaged and sold. In July, issuance of credit-card asset-backed 
securities fell to $4.4 billion from $5.26 billion in June, according to
 J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p class="caption">Second quarter was quite a quarter: The S&amp;P 500 
Energy Sector index was up 21% during between 04/01/08 and 06/30/08 
while the S&amp;P 500 Financial Sector Index was down was down 21% 
during the same period.</p>

<p class="caption">Lots of Drama: This next graph shows crude oil stocks
 (iPath S&amp;P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index) vs shares of Lehman 
between 04/01/08 and 06/30/08. The oil index was up 40% during the 
quarter while Lehman was down more than 55% during the period.</p>

<h3>US Dollar.</h3>
<p>Looking closely at the 5 year graph of the dollar against the euro, 
one can see that the dollar took a brief respite from its plunge against
 the Euro during the end of Q2, however, there is little reason to think
 that we are out of the woods. Foreign wars, spiking energy costs, 
national debt and a troubled economy all will be drags on the currency. 
Exports do appear to be picking up. That’s the good news. In the long 
run, we will come out of this positioned to be much more competitive.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile energy costs will continue to bite at our heels. 
Domestic wages and lower housing prices will help hold down domestic 
inflation in a macro sense, but food and many critical goods will be 
more expensive. The dollar holding world will continue to finance our 
national debt, but it seems likely they will want to extract more 
interest for this privilege.</p>
