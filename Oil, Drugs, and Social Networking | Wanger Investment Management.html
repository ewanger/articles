    <p>Our analyst team recently attended Global Hunter’s “land based 
drillers” conference, an overview of industry economics that included 
presentations by four firms that own, lease, staff, and operate land 
based oil rigs. These are relatively small pub¬lic companies that 
provide contract drilling services for clients that need gas and oil 
wells drilled. As one might expect, there was a lot of discussion about 
the prices of gas and oil. The price of oil was (is) impressively high 
based on a dramatic increase in middle-east unrest, heavy speculation, 
and big money flows looking for a place to invest. Likewise, the price 
of natural gas was (is) impressively low.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Crude Oil (WTI) &amp; Natural Gas Prices: December 2008 – May 2011</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="Oil,%20Drugs,%20and%20Social%20Networking%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/Oil%252520and%252520natural%252520gas%252520prices%252520chart%252520-%252.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 200px;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:9px;"><strong>Source: Bloomberg</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the more interesting things we learned:</p><ul><li>Few
 in attendance believed that oil could maintain its (then) current 
$110-120 per barrel price levels for very long, believing that such high
 prices represented short-term speculative bets and middle-east risk 
premia, not underlying demand or supply issues.</li><li>On the 
flip-side, these same analysts seemed to think that $60-$70 is about as 
low as oil can legitimately go at this point given actual supply and 
demand conditions.</li><li>Relatively conservative balance sheets are in
 fashion among this crowd. While capital is plentiful and avail­able to 
these land drillers, they are terrified of taking more money than they 
can put to work right away. The last crash was so severe that it “put 
the fear of God” into their CFOs. None of these smaller land drillers 
are will­ing to get “overbanked” again.</li><li>Natural gas is once 
again a fuel of choice for electricity generation, especially in parts 
of the country (such as the Northeast) that have under-invested in 
nuclear power and can’t safely and cleanly burn coal.</li><li>As one might expect, the gas rig count continues to drop while oil seeking projects are exploding in number.</li></ul><p>Admittedly, that’s all pretty mundane stuff. Competent, in­teresting, possibly useful, but certainly dull. Dry as dust.</p><p>Want
 something a bit more interesting? What did every single senior 
executive in the room mention as his number one concern after trying to 
get and retain customers? Every man­agement team in the room 
agreed:&nbsp; Finding and keeping com­petent employees is the toughest 
problem they face. The reason? Rampant drug use!</p><hr><h3>Rampant Drug Use</h3><p>Working
 on an oil rig is a tough job. It’s dirty outdoor work. It’s hot. It’s 
cold. It’s wet. It’s icy. Nobody ever said it was work for wimps. But it
 pays really, really well. Here is a job that doesn’t require a high 
school diploma that can start at over $50,000 per year. Furthermore, 
hard working, experienced rig crew mem­bers can make in excess of 
$100,000 per year if they are respon­sible and can manage others.</p><p>Obviously,
 these companies have to maintain a zero toler­ance posture on drug 
abuse. Their people are operating heavy machinery in tough outdoor 
conditions. The equipment is heavy and prone to difficulties. Injury is 
common and safety is a constant concern. Yet, in a world where populist 
politicians regularly complain that American workers can no longer get a
 decent job without a fancy education, I am listening to a bunch of 
senior corporate officials telling me that they can’t find a suf­ficient
 numbers of workers that will come to work straight and sober for 
$50,000 per year.</p><p>Admittedly, there’s not much to do for fun on 
your days off, but that’s hardly a new problem. When did bored, lonely, 
and recently-paid oil, gold, coal, timber, or cattlemen ever behave like
 Eagle Scouts on their personal time? The highly paid “suits” at the 
conference were not complaining about whiskey or vene­real disease among
 the lowly, poorly paid, or disenfranchised. They were complaining about
 the rampant, recreational use of cocaine, methamphetamines, heroine, 
andother hard-core, ad­dictive illegal drugs among unionized workers 
earning solid middle-class wages.</p><p>One official told us that merely
 announcing mandatory drug testing dramatically lowered his job 
application rate. An­other told us that his firm went to hair follicle 
testing because urinalysis only caught marijuana abuse and was too easy 
to fool by people using methamphetamine or cocaine on their days off.</p><p>Americans
 demand drugs — lots of drugs. So it is a basic law of economics that 
there will be huge efforts put into supplying drugs to Americans — and 
the current policy regime keeps it so profitable that it is worth 
killing people for the right to sell drugs. It was no different with 
oil, booze, or even newspapers back “in the day.” People beat and even 
killed each other competing for the right to own the channels of 
distribu­tion.</p><p>Basic economics guarantees that as long as 
Americans are willing to pay high prices for drugs, illegal or not, 
nearly infinite effort will be put into meeting that demand. No honest 
free-marketeer can deny this fact.</p><p>In 1931, Aldous Huxley wrote <em>Brave New World</em>,
 a science fiction novel rooted in social commentary (“Praise Ford!”). 
He foresaw our future in his eerie utopia with our entire population 
continually popping state-sanctioned recreational narcotics. In his 
world, psychotropic drugs were a tool of political control as much as of
 psychic self-medication. But as far back as 1931, he saw taking pills 
as part of the fabric of our society.</p><hr><h3>What We Think About Energy and Other Commodities</h3><p>In
 the long-run, the price of oil will keep ramping higher, but the 
short-term will inevitably see the same zigzaw pattern we have always 
seen. In the short-term, the price is as likely to head back down to $70
 per barrel as it is to jump back up above $110. Many oil and gas stocks
 have or will become cheap again after coming off huge bull-market 
run-ups. Stocks like Double Eagle Petroleum (DBLE) and Venoco (VQ), for 
example, can be pur­chased at or below the value of their proven 
hydrocarbon re­serves. It might be awhile before these stocks peak 
again, but it’s hard to argue with tangible asset value.</p><p>America 
continues to be awash in coal. But Americans, at least right now, 
universally despise this abundant natural re­source. Why aren’t we 
investing in the technology necessary to burn coal cheaply and cleanly? 
I’m sure the answer is political. In any case, high quality coal is 
expensive and dirty coal is cheap. And coal is expensive to export to 
the countries clamoring for supplies of it. Unfortunately for us, coal 
stocks are hard for us to buy, because they are so cyclical and momentum
 driven.</p><p>Food prices have soared. Droughts in China and other 
Asian regions have caused significant food shortages. Weather problems 
havecoupled with market distorting subsidies (such as America’s Ethanol 
subsidy for corn farmers) to create the wealthiest American farmer we’ve
 seen in a long time. One result, American farm land is selling for huge
 prices, maybe even at “bubble” levels. We are hard at work looking to 
invest in things that wealthy farmers want to buy.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Corn Prices: January 2009 – May 2011</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><img alt="" src="Oil,%20Drugs,%20and%20Social%20Networking%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/Corn%2520prices%2520graph.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 200px;"></strong></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:9px;"><strong>Source: Bloomberg</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly,
 there is another tech-bubble under way. This time it’s the social 
networking companies likeFacebook, GroupOn, LinkedIn, and others that 
are acting like the proverbial cow jumping over the moon. Are GroupOn 
and LinkedIn going to be Googles or Alta Vista? Are they going to be 
Yahoo’s or NeXTs? Hard to tell. But I doubt any of the investment banks 
will return any of their hefty fees when we find out.</p><p>Eric Wanger, JD, CFA, <em><span class="byline">President,<br>
