    <p>April of 1970 was an amazing time in American history: Richard 
Nixon was President, American Motors introduced the Gremlin, the Beatles
 officially disbanded, China launched its first satellite on the back of
 a Long March rocket, and the U.S. invaded Cambodia, inciting waves of 
protests throughout the country.</p><p>It was also almost forty years 
ago that an amazing dialogue took place between Astronaut Jack Swigert 
of Apollo 13 and mission control: In Mission Control, capcom Joe Kerwin 
asked, “Have you guys completed your income tax?” For Jack Swigert, the 
question brought a sudden pang of apprehension. From space came the 
words, “How do I apply for an extension?”</p><p>“Things happened real fast down there,” Swigert continued, “and I do need an extension.”</p><p>Kerwin
 tried to control his laughter, but Swigert wasn’t laughing. “I didn’t 
get mine filed,” he told Kerwin. “I’m really serious. I may be spending 
time in a another quarantine besides the one they were planning for me,”
 Swigert said, referring to the post-mission period of medical 
confinement. But just then, Flight Director Glynn Lunney offered words 
of reassurance:</p><p>“American citizens out of the country get a 60-day
 extension on filing,” Lunney radioed, and added wryly, “I assume this 
applies to you.” (Source: www.space.com with special thanks to Chicago’s
 Adler Planetarium, America’s oldest planetarium.)</p><p>It wasn’t until
 later in the famous flight that Swigert said, “Houston, we’ve had a 
problem,” which would come to symbolize NASA at its heroic, stoic best. 
An oxygen tank exploded in their spacecraft, ripping portions of it to 
shreds. Suddenly, their plans to walk on the moon became a fight for 
survival while returning to Earth. One of the most interesting aspects 
of the Apollo 13 rescue was the way that Houston and the astronauts had 
to scrape together and reuse a random assortment of spacecraft systems, 
parts, and even battery charges to get back to Earth alive. The movie 
included some wonderful footage, showing everyone involved using duct 
tape to piece together the various and sundry spaceship parts necessary 
to keep the astronauts alive long enough to return home.</p><hr><h3>Never Trust Anyone Over 30</h3><p>There
 is a feeling in the air that America is in chaos. It’s as if we 
invented chaos, mistrust of government, huge, seemingly irretrievable 
schisms between the left and right, the rich and the poor, and the 
capitalist and the unionist.</p><p>The period surrounding 1970 was a 
time of extraordinary social stress. Rioting took place in urban 
neighborhoods, American soldiers deployed to kill and be killed in the 
Vietnam War, police and anti-war protestors exchanged bullets, and the 
famously anti-communist President Richard Nixon desperately tried to 
keep the whole thing from blowing apart.</p><p>Whether you were over or 
under thirty in 1970, I suspect you thought the world was coming to an 
end. My mother claims that in the late sixties she took me on the roof 
of our building to watch the bright lights caused by burning Chicago 
neighborhoods. In truth, I don’t remember. Things do seem irreparably 
chaotic right now, but they did then too. And it wasn’t the first time 
by any stretch of the imagination. An honest accounting of U.S. history 
shows that America has always been full of internal strife. Yet, despite
 it all, we somehow emerged with our battletested ideal of the dignity 
of the individual sufficiently intact to get the train back onto the 
rails.</p><p>Chaotic times seem to produce inflation, which may be our 
long-term destiny too but probably not in the short-term. Despite the 
inflationary effects of trillion dollar deficits, huge trade imbalances,
 and foreign wars, we aren’t necessarily on the brink of inflation. 
Housing has gotten cheaper and food prices don’t appear to be increasing
 mercilessly (an interesting conversation). Additionally, we are awash 
in unexpectedly cheap natural gas, driving down the value of coal and 
other major home heating and electricity generation inputs. As long as 
we don’t have a major oil shock, we might dodge the inflationary bullet 
for the near-term. In fact, over the next year or two, there are people 
who are seriously worried about a stalled deflationary scenario or even a
 Jimmy Carter-esque stagflation, if you throw in runaway oil prices.</p><p>Given
 that labor has become one of the most expensive economic inputs in the 
American economy, it is also easy to believe that American companies 
using American labor have become more competitive over the past few 
years relative to many other developed countries. Productivity is 
defined as something like the ratio of economic output measured in 
dollars per unit of human employment input measured in time. Based on 
this definition, it is easy to intuit that American productivity has 
soared over the past few years. This should ultimately return us to 
economic growth, at least in the areas of our economy which have not 
been overly lawyered.</p><hr><h3>What Will Get us Back on the Rails?</h3><p>Some
 of the trends that are the most nervous-making are also the most 
critical. For example, the rise of the developing world and immigration 
are two of the most important factors in America’s long-term strength. 
The developing countries will clearly grow the fastest. Albeit from a 
relatively small base, the developing world — as demonstrated by its 
platinum selling rock stars India and China—is going to continue to put 
annualized GDP growth numbers north of five percent on the scoreboard 
for a long time. The middle class in India is about as big as the entire
 population of the United States. And only one-in-six citizens of the 
planet is from India! As long as one doesn’t put too much stock in the 
published numbers, those nations are virtually guaranteed to produce 
more and more consumers for the goods and services America is best at 
producing: Energy, protein-rich diets, health care, and entertainment. 
But like investing in the United States a century ago, there are vast 
fortunes available to those that can pick the winners—but the devil will
 take the hindmost.</p><p>Immigration is the other factor that is going 
to save us. Immigration is the phenomenon where people leave their lives
 behind to come to America to work, receive an education, survive, or 
obtain a better family life. Millions of people even risk their lives 
and liberties to come to this country in order to participate in our 
economy, often working the hardest and most unpleasant jobs our economy 
has to offer. Could this country function without immigrants? No. Not 
now and not ever. Without new immigrants our low birth rate would put us
 in line to be the next Russia, Japan, or even Italy; countries that are
 failing to sufficiently replenish their populations.</p><p>Despite the 
bad press, developing nations and immigration are the best long-term 
prospects for the United States’ economy. The developing world is hard 
at work creating economic participants. Further, immigration into the 
U.S. is creating a younger generation capable of taking care of an aging
 America in its dotage.</p><p>To a wealthy American eager to balance 
capital protection, current income, and growth, it is more important 
than ever to have “true” diversification. By this we mean taking 
advantage of the enormous growth opportunities available throughout the 
world, while maintaining a portfolio of assets that will not travel in 
“lockstep” during booms and busts. A portfolio which is truly 
diversified will attempt to balance total return (total return = 
unrealized gains in valuation + cash flows), risk of loss, liquidity, 
and correlation. Thus, true diversification also means looking at a 
world of investments that is much broader than merely stocks and bonds, 
which have proven to be much too correlated as the world’s economies and
 markets grow together. The world may seem like it’s falling apart, but 
it isn’t the first time and it won’t be the last. Apollo 13 is an apt 
metaphor for 1970s America and may also apply to America in 2010; they 
held it together and so can we.</p><p>Apollo 13 is one of most gripping 
stories of heroism and bravery in the history of human space 
exploration. And while one must marvel at the creativity and backbone of
 the men and women in the ship and those guiding them back on Earth, one
 must never forget the ultimate lesson of Apollo 13: Never, ever, go 
anywhere without duct tape.</p><p class="signoff">Eric Wanger, JD, CFA <span class="byline">President,<br>
