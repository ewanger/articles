<p>There are no longer any stockbrokers left in the United States.
    Not a single one. They didn’t actually disappear, rather their jobs
    evolved into something similar but different. Many retired, many were
    fired. The ones that survived and thrived were savvy enough to reinvent
    themselves as Wealth Managers, Asset Managers, Financial Planners,
    Investment Advisors, Wealth Consultants, Financial Product Consultants,
    Service Representatives, Relationship Managers, and my personal
    favorite, the Investment Strategy Consultant to High Net Worth
    Individuals.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""

    the classic cigar chomping “smile and dial” broker still exist.
    Certainly yes, but he or she is peddling different wares and getting
    paid on a different kind of commission schedule, especially since
    low-skill stock selection and bond picking can be replaced with cheap
    and liquid mutual funds ETF’s and other professionally managed vehicles.
    And, frankly, unless he or she can add more value than merely showing
    off a low handicap and Princeton diploma, he or she will have a tough
    time getting rich in today’s climate.</p><p>Unrelenting downward price
    pressure on trading commissions and brutally efficient communications
    technology has made an indelible impression on the industry. Asset
    management fees, wrap fees, discount brokerage fees, embedded
    administrative fees, and other forms of low “sticker shock” pricing have
    fundamentally changed the way financial services are bought and sold.
    Does this mean that commissions have gone away? No, it does not.
    However, it does mean that the various fees, spreads, commissions, and
    loads which keep the wheels of the system greased are harder to ferret
    out.</p><p>It’s harder than ever to “follow the money.” Who, for
    example, gets paid when you buy an ETF? From every share of an ETF that
    is bought or sold, money has to be shared with distributors,
    originators, market makers,derivative counter-parties, fund
    administrators, lawyers, accountants, custodians, clearing agents,
    federal agencies, etc. Oh yes, and don’t forget the firm that actually
    makes the investment decisions! We wouldn’t want to forget them — they
    get a little bit.</p><p>The financial services industry is as dynamic
    and rapidly changing as any industry around and, unsurprisingly, it has
    undergone tremendous changes as part of the Information Age. It’s very
    fashionable right now to bemoan financial “innovation,” however, that is
    about as meaningful as bemoaning gravity, evolution, or climate change.
    Complaining about the inevitable is fun, but not that interesting. The
    days of fixed brokerage commissions, when a young institutional salesman
    could make his year in a single trade are the stuff of glory days and
    war stories.</p><p><br>

    The Big Shrink from Registered Rep, Feb 1, 2012, by Diana Britton
    (http://registeredrep.com/institutions/independent_bro­ker_dealers/finance_big_shrink/).</em></span></p><p>Remember,
    as an investor there are really only a small num­ber of things you can
    truly receive in exchange for your com­missions, fees, expenses, or
    charges. Despite all of the incredible marketing and packaging, the
    financial services industry sells a remarkably small number of services.
    But in the end, these are: access to capital, reallocation of risk,
    liquidity, and advice.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access to capital means making money
        or other re­sources available to people that need it now in ex­change
        for some promise to do something later. It can be as simple as a loan,
        or as complex as some kind of contingent cash flow arrangement. But in
        the end, one of the few basic functions of the financial industry is to
        provide capital to people that need it. The flip-side of access to
        capital is, of course, unearned income. Un­earned income is just the
        name for capital providers side of the deal. It is commonly called
        interest, divi­dends, returns, or rent.
    </li>
    <li>Reallocation of Risk
        means making contracts with “counterparties” that involve buying or
        selling a piece of future risk in exchange for something. This is
        insur­ance. This is stock options. This is credit default swaps. This is
        any form of financial transaction which exists to help people slice and
        dice the risk of future events. Over the centuries we have elevated the
        presentation and complexity of these arrangements to the level of
        Beethoven symphonies decked out in peacock feathers, but in the end, you
        are buying or selling the realloca­tion of risk.
    </li>
    <li>Liquidity
        means access to a market which allows you to exchange something you have
        for something else you want more. Finance geeks call these secondary
        markets. These can be as sophisticated as electronic exchanges or as
        unadorned as a listing on Craig’s list. One of the basic services worth
        buying from the finan­cial services industry is access to liquidity, the
        means of trading something you have for something else you want.
    </li>
    <li>Advice
        means just that, trying to learn important things from other people. In
        truth, thinking about money is complex and anxiety-producing. It is
        ex­tremely useful to have access to people that can evalu­ate
        situations, handicap investment opportunities, make accurate
        calculations or thoughtful presenta­tions, and, of course, try to help
        decide who is telling the truth and who is stretching it a bit too far.
        Advice is a valuable and worthwhile thing to have and, as such, is one
        of the basic services provided by the financial services industry.
    </li>
</ul><p>This
    discussion may seem a bit philosophical, but it is actu­ally quite
    practical. The next time anyone (except me, of course) tries to sell you
    any type of financial product or service, ask yourself one simple
    question: What are the services or promises embedded in this
    transaction? What does this purchase or sale mean to me in terms of
    access to capital, reallocation of risk, liquidity, and advice.</p>
<hr><h3>The Artists Formerly Known As Stockbrokers</h3><p>The
    retail or wholesale representatives of the financial ser­vices industry
    may no longer call themselves stockbrokers, but that doesn’t mean their
    jobs have gone away. It is very easy to be cynical about salesmen. But
    good salesmen educate, serve, and follow up as part of the sales
    process.</p><p>The tectonic changes in the financial services industry
    will probably continue at an increasing rate as the world globalizes and
    the pace of technological change and knowledge dissemi­nation continues
    to accelerate. There is no telling what job titles people will use; or,
    how basic financial services will be packaged, sold or wrapped. But be
    certain that governments will continue their unending attempt to
    manipulate markets for both pro-social and cynical reasons. Also be
    certain that there will exist a class of retail and institutional
    salesmen, both impressively competent and terrifyingly poor, that will
    want to help you manage your hard earned money.</p><p>Eric Wanger, JD, CFA</p>
