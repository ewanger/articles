    <p>If you’re very, very quiet, you can hear it, an entire universe of very small public companies crying out in the night:</p>
<blockquote>“Help us! Long Term investors, come help us! Come buy our 
shares! We’re unloved because we’re small and cheap because we can’t be 
margined or shorted easily. Many of our very small brethren are starved 
for cash or stuck without research coverage—but not us. We’re 
profitable, rapidly growing, or have great dividend yields. Many of us 
have cash rich balance sheets with no debt. We’re the healthy ones. Our 
valuations are affordable for the first time in years. Long Term 
Investors come save us! Help us, Long Term Investors! You’re our only 
hope.”</blockquote>
<p>This, my friends, is the Call of the Small. Long term investors 
should be greedily looking at small public companies in the US. 
Valuations have come in, timing is right, and the universe is generally 
unloved.</p>
<img src="Time%20to%20Invest_%20It%E2%80%99s%20The%20Call%20of%20the%20Small%20%7C%20Wanger%20Investment%20Management_files/price-to-earnings.gif">
<h3>Valuations are Good</h3>
<p>Valuations of very small firms are very good right now. Many have 
been dumped simply because their market capitalizations fail to meet 
some arbitrary limits. Silly? We think so. One way of measuring this is 
Price to earnings ratios, the price investors are willing to pay for 
trailing (actual) or future (estimated) earnings. Despite earnings 
expectations coming down, forward P/E ratios on smaller public companies
 (Russell 2000) have come down significantly since the beginning of the 
year, more than the shares medium sized (Nasdaq) or large firms (S&amp;P
 500).</p>
<p>Small Company growth is especially cheap. Some of our favorite small 
growers are firms like Amerigon (ARGN), ClickSoftware (CKSW), 
Cybsersource (CYBS) and Stratasys (SSYS). Patient long-term investors 
can buy the +20% growth of these cash rich, debt free growers for nearly
 half the price of only one year ago.</p>
<p>As prices come down, yields come up. Where can you get dividends 
(some north of 10%) from solid small companies—firms that are going to 
survive and thrive? Ituran (ITRN), Mortgage Financial (MFA), Redwood 
Trust (RWT) and Enerflex (EFX) are some of our recent picks. Financials?
 What? Yes, it’s true: Not all financials are created equal. We look at 
the balance sheets. You’d be surprised what you can find if you are 
willing to overlook the “smallness” factor.</p>
<h3>The Timing is Good</h3>
<p>It is popular to say that the current financial crisis is really 
about the repricing of risk. In our world that means that the “Equity 
Risk Premium” is being repriced. The ERP is an abstract concept which 
represents the amount equity investors demand to be paid (in the form of
 dividends or capital appreciation) above equivalently risky debt. (The 
CAPM formulation uses beta and the risk free rate to compute ERP). The 
equity markets plunged during Q1 as equity investors demanded more 
reward for the risks they were going to take owning equities. Nowhere 
was this more pronounced than in the area of very small stocks. Small 
caps vs large caps? Clearly, small caps have taken in on the chin.</p>
<h3>The Space is Unloved</h3>
<p>When a universe is hated, quality gets cheap too. Very small company 
stocks are clearly hated right now. And despite the prejudices against 
this asset class, many of these companies are cash rich, will continue 
to grow well and even pay dividends. Some of them represent 
extraordinary values trading at PEG ratios well below 1 and PE ratios 
below 10 times. But it is definitely the time to look for high-quality, 
solidly growing small public companies. Remember, the time to invest is 
when they are cheap, not when they’re expensive!</p>
<p>Now is the time for the Long Term Opportunity Fund to put money to work. It’s the right time to answer the Call of the Small.</p>
<p>Do you hear it? Above the hue and cry of unemployed Manhattan 
Investment bankers hoofing apples and pencils on the streets of 
Manhattan—it’s not some Steve Martin comedy routine, go ask Alice, it’s 
the Call of the Small.</p>
