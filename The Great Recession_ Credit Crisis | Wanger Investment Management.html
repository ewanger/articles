    <p>The biggest tragedy of this year may be the good companies taken 
down by the lack of available credit. Unless we can meaningfully address
 the credit crisis in the US (and most of the rest of the world), we 
will soon see good, solvent companies fail because they cannot refinance
 good, performing loans to continue their operations. The banking system
 is in disarray. Both the banks and their customers have responded with 
wave after wave of layoffs. But it won’t be enough to repair shattered 
bank balance sheets. With or without “mark to market” accounting, many 
of the biggest banks in the country are operating on equity ratios so 
slim that they would be considered “busted” in ordinary times.</p>
<p>This is no mere credit “crunch.” And not even the most die-hard 
free-marketer can simply refer to this situation as “creative 
destruction.” There is no way we are going to get through this one 
without a significant injection of public money. How for example, will 
commercial real estate firms continue to operate without a well 
functioning debt market? Even the best managed operators use significant
 leverage and have a frequent need to “roll paper.” We’ve already seen 
the auction rate securities and commercial paper markets freeze up over 
the last 6 months which played havoc on working capital.</p>
<p>But what is an ordinary credit “crunch” and why is this situation different? Why has it become a full fledged credit “crisis”?</p>
<h3>What is a Credit Crisis?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the term credit “crunch.” It’s a slang term which means:</p>
<blockquote<an economic="" condition="" in="" which="" investment="" capital="" is="" difficult="" to="" obtain.="" banks="" and="" investors="" become="" wary="" of="" lending="" funds="" corporations,="" drives="" up="" the="" price="" debt="" products="" for="" borrowers....credit="" crunches="" are="" usually="" considered="" be="" an="" extension="" recessions.="" a="" credit="" crunch="" makes="" it="" nearly="" impossible="" companies="" borrow="" because="" lenders="" scared="" bankruptcies="" or="" defaults,="" results="" higher="" rates.="" consequence="" prolonged="" recession="" (or="" slower="" recovery),="" occurs="" as="" result="" shrinking="" supply.="" (source:="" investopedia)<="" blockquote="">
<p>Such a credit crunch is considered to be a manageable part of any 
meaningful economic trough. It’s not fun, but it is a necessary part of a
 healthy capitalist economy. Credit gets more expensive and marginal 
projects get put on hold; the free market is applying appropriate checks
 and balances, creative destruction, the discipline of the market, etc. 
Eventually, demand for credit falls and rates come down, allowing the 
cycle to eventually repeat.</p>
<p>A credit “crisis,” however, is a slang term for a severe, 
unmanageable version of a credit crunch. A credit crisis is a situation 
in which the tightening of credit and the ability of firms to ride out 
the economic downturn goes well beyond the ability of normal market 
forces (and central banks) to nudge the system back in the right 
direction.</p>
<p>That seems to be where we are right now. But why aren’t the banks 
lending? Didn’t we just inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the 
banking system?</p>
<h3>Why is this Happening?</h3>
<p>The man on the street will tell you that too many banks made too many
 bad loans, that the government was too lax in enforcing its rules, and 
that too many Wall Streeters got drunk on leverage. That all seems to be
 perfectly true. But what about the “Troubled Asset Relief Program” or 
“TARP”? At least $350 billion were already “injected” into US banks to 
prop up shaky balance sheets and get the banks to lend—with more on the 
way.</p>
<p>Banks are faced with a fundamental problem. Despite very attractive 
lending spreads, despite weak balance sheets, and despite short term 
deflation which actually increases the “real” profit for lending money, 
banks are simply terrified to loan money in an environment filled with 
riskier and riskier credits. Who knows who will go bust next?</p>
<p>Spreads may be high, but credit risk appears crippling. Rapidly 
climbing default rates make lending a very tough game for a solid bank. 
Weak banks simply don’t want to play. Credit standards have gone up, 
interest rates have gone up and the “price” of credit has gone up in 
every form. But despite seemingly huge spreads available to anyone 
willing to lend, good companies will still go wanting.</p>
<h3>No, this one really is different.</h3>
<p>The textbooks explain how the history of banking and credit is 
interwoven with the history of economic cycles, macroeconomic sine waves
 with frequencies that can span decades. Such expansions and 
contractions are nothingnew. As far as we know, they’ve existed as long 
as people have participated in credit or lending anywhere. The milder 
parts of the wave (lower amplitudes) are generally called “the business 
cycle” and the big ones (high amplitude) are called “booms and busts.” 
The peaks and troughs have many names: highs and lows, easy credit and 
tight credit, optimism and pessimism, greed and fear, etc.</p>
<p>One key feature of these cycles is that they are irregular and 
unpredictable, both in magnitude and duration. Many statistical tools 
have been developed to measure them (GNP, GDP, CPI, M1, M2, unemployment
 rate, etc.) and many regulatory and governmental tools have been 
developed to try to mitigate their rampages (central banks, reserve 
ratios, government lending/borrowing, wealth redistribution, various 
forms of fiscal stimulation, etc.) Yet the business cycle is still 
considered as basic to capitalism as fleas to a dog.</p>
<p>But this credit crunch has broken out of the amplitude range we 
associate with a normal, even deep trough. This crisis starts with the 
“popping” of the biggest housing and credit bubble in history. America’s
 home prices are down by more than 21% since their peak in 2006. 
(Source: CaseSchiller Housing Index) Many analysts expect another 10% 
drop across the country, which would bring the cumulative decline in 
nominal house prices close to that during the Depression. Worldwide 
losses on debt originated in America (primarily related to mortgages) is
 expected to exceed $1.4 trillion. Statistics from third quarter, 2008 
showed that $760 billion had been written down by the banks, insurance 
companies, hedge funds and others that own the debt. The IMF’s “base 
case” is that American and European banks will shed some $10 trillion of
 assets, equivalent to 14.5% of their stock of bank credit in 2009. 
(Source: Economist and IMF)</p>
<p>It’s going to take a long time to get ourselves out of this one. But 
nearly every pundit we see has come to the same conclusion: This banking
 crises cannot be solved without public money. Whether we choose to 
continue recapitalizing banks through brute-force federal investment or 
use some RTC-style “bad bank” scenario, decisive government action will 
be required to minimize the damage to the economy. This one really is 
different.</p>
